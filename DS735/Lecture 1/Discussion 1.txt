Hello DS735!. My name is Jeff Watson and I live in North Carolina. I've been married to my wonderful wife for 15 years and we have a lovely, although angsty, 11-year-old daughter. I graduated from pharmacy school in 2008 and worked as a staff pharmacist in the hospital until 2016 when I moved into a management position. As of yesterday, I am transitioning into a data scientist role in our new analytics devision. My decision to pursue a degree in data science started when I moved into a leadership role in my organization. I started to realize the value of data and the vast quantities of it that wasn't being used. This is my fourth semester in the program. My long-term goal is to bring data science into the health care realm to reduce ED visits and hospital admissions for patients with chronic diseases like diabetes, heart failure, and COPD. This population makes up a disproportionate amount of resources, and I feel like better, more tailored medical management could be a win for all parties.
