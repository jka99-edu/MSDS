DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
This dataset contains data from a caf�, called Executive Express, run by undergraduate business students at a Midwestern public university. It was collected over a ten-week period from January to April 2010. Variables include a number of types of items sold and wasted, along with total sales values. These data can be used to illustrate basic concepts of time series and forecasting, including trend, seasonality, and decomposition. The dataset may be of special relevance to instructors of business statistics students, who can utilize it to involve students in making data-driven business decisions. This data set is to accompany the article entitled Caf� Data.
